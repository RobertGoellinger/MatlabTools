## Logging
A simple logger instance designed to be instanciated by calling: 
`logger = Logging.Logger()`
The logger instance will use the logfile path and name defined in `Settings.m`.
If you want to write a log message with the logger you need to retrieve the logger instance first and then call the logging level and message.
